Dr. Garcia,

Hello, my name is Mr. Sanchez and my wife, Mrs. Sanchez, and I are concerned about our son, Jr. Sanchez, who has been coming home with F's every week from your class. Can we have set up a parent teacher conference to talk about our failure of a son's grades? Thank you very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, much for taking the time to read this.

Regards,
Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez
