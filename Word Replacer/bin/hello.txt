Hello World!
My name is Ryan.
This is a practice essay to be used for the Essay Helper program.

Here we will be displaying examples of sentences that
need some help and this here is an example of a run-on sentence that
will probably be detected by too many words and we will probably
suggest that they need to add some commas or break up the sentence
with some extra periods.

Next we will look for words that are used way too often. For example,
if we use the word "next" more than 5 percent of the time then the word
will be flagged and a suggestion will pop up. Next next next next next. 
Next next next next next next next next next next next next next next.
